                Added AST creation.

            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
                Added finite state automaton for replacing Unicode escape sequences '\\uxxxx' 
                with character values. Incomplete Unicode escape sequences are written
                back unchanged in the file stream.
                Optimizations to avoid write operations lead to MODIFIED_DATA_STATE 
                and data_buffer_modified. The rationale for deviations from pure doctrine 
                where to keep the number of status small.
                In the usual case of no Unicode escape sequences in the data stream 
                the maxime is to do (nearly) nothing, just loop in the START_STATE.
                Incomplete Unicode escape sequences are left as found in the file stream.

                Update of grammar to current definition of Sparql 1.1 at http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query, 
                which includes Sparql Update.
                Codepoint escape sequences are not accounted in this grammar. As mentioned in the 
                W3C Working Draft 14 October 2010 in chapter 18.2 "Codepoint Escape Sequences":
                "...Codepoint escape sequences can appear anywhere in the query string. 
                They are processed before parsing based on the grammar rules and so may be replaced
                by codepoints with significance in the grammar, such as ":" marking a prefixed name...."
