                Corrected modify rule and its AST generation.
            </action>
            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
                What has been done:
                
                Update of grammar to current definition of Sparql 1.1 at http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query, 
                which includes Sparql Update. This refers to the version of 1th of May 2011.
                
                AST generation added. 
                
                Some remarks regarding various rules and test cases:
                
                1)  The Sparql.g lexer rule for PN_LOCAL must be refined, as it does not cope with trailing '.'.
                    Syntactic predicates and/or greedy=false did not solve the problem of recognizing properly
                    e.g. A.b. as two tokens PN_LOCAL A.b and DOT 
                
                       PN_LOCAL : (PN_CHARS_U|DIGIT) ((PN_CHARS|DOT)* PN_CHARS)?;
                       
                    Example:
                       PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
                       PREFIX person: <http://localhost/persons/>
                       PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

                       ASK {person:John_Q_Public rdf:type foaf:Person.}
                       
                2)  I18n test cases have been successfully evaluated with AntlrWorks. GUnit seems to have
                    a problem with these test cases and evalutes them as failed.
                
                3)  A preprocessor for Unicode escape sequences has been successfully tested
                    with the Unicode test cases. GUnit will evaluate these test cases as failed.
            </action>
            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
                Added AST creation.
            </action>
            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
                Added finite state automaton for replacing Unicode escape sequences '\\uxxxx' 
                with character values. Incomplete Unicode escape sequences are written
                back unchanged in the file stream.
                Optimizations to avoid write operations lead to MODIFIED_DATA_STATE 
                and data_buffer_modified. The rationale for deviations from pure doctrine 
                where to keep the number of status small.
                In the usual case of no Unicode escape sequences in the data stream 
                the maxime is to do (nearly) nothing, just loop in the START_STATE.
                Incomplete Unicode escape sequences are left as found in the file stream.

            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
                Update of grammar to current definition of Sparql 1.1 at http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query, 
                which includes Sparql Update. This refers to the version of 14th of October 2010.
                Codepoint escape sequences are not accounted in this grammar. As mentioned in the 
                W3C Working Draft 14 October 2010 in chapter 18.2 "Codepoint Escape Sequences":
                "...Codepoint escape sequences can appear anywhere in the query string. 
                They are processed before parsing based on the grammar rules and so may be replaced
                by codepoints with significance in the grammar, such as ":" marking a prefixed name...."
