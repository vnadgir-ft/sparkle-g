               The w3c SPARQL definition has some slight modifications, which are adapted by the following changes:
               - separate strReplaceExpression rule for REPLACE command
               - solutionModifier added to askQuery rule
            </action>
            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
               Updated the grammar to the W3C Working Draft 05 January 2012.
               1) Backslash character escapes in prefixed names
               2) Remove SHA224 from hash function choices
            </action>
            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="fix">
               - Added optional DOT token to quads rule.
               - Restrictions for short form of CONSTRUCT corrected as defined in the w3.org SPARQL 1.1 definition:
                 A short form for the CONSTRUCT query form is provided for the case where the template and the pattern are the same and the pattern is just a basic graph pattern (no FILTERs and no complex graph patterns are allowed in the short form). The keyword WHERE is required in the short form.
                 The affected testcases from the DAWG test set have been switched to FAILED.

        Update of grammar to current definition of Sparql 1.1 at http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query, 
        which includes Sparql Update. This refers to the version of 1th of May 2011.

        AST generation added.

        Tree grammar added.

            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
        The Sparql.g lexer rule for PN_LOCAL had to be refined, as it did not cope with trailing '.'.
        Syntactic predicates and/or greedy=false did not solve the problem of recognizing properly
        the input e.g.  A.b.  as two tokens PN_LOCAL A.b and DOT 

           PN_LOCAL : (PN_CHARS_U|DIGIT) ((PN_CHARS|DOT)* PN_CHARS)?;

        Example:

           ASK {person:John_Q_Public rdf:type foaf:Person.}

            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
        I18n test cases have been successfully evaluated with AntlrWorks. GUnit seems to have
        a problem with these test cases and evalutes them as failed.
            </action>
            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
        A preprocessor for Unicode escape sequences has been successfully tested
        with the Unicode test cases. GUnit will evaluate these test cases as failed.
            </action>
            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
        Added AST creation.
            </action>
            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
        Added finite state automaton for replacing Unicode escape sequences '\\uxxxx' 
        with character values. Incomplete Unicode escape sequences are written
        back unchanged in the file stream.
        Optimizations to avoid write operations lead to MODIFIED_DATA_STATE 
        and data_buffer_modified. The rationale for deviations from pure doctrine 
        where to keep the number of status small.
        In the usual case of no Unicode escape sequences in the data stream 
        the maxime is to do (nearly) nothing, just loop in the START_STATE.
        Incomplete Unicode escape sequences are left as found in the file stream.

            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
        Update of grammar to current definition of Sparql 1.1 at http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query, 
        which includes Sparql Update. This refers to the version of 14th of October 2010.
        Codepoint escape sequences are not accounted in this grammar. As mentioned in the 
        W3C Working Draft 14 October 2010 in chapter 18.2 "Codepoint Escape Sequences":
        "...Codepoint escape sequences can appear anywhere in the query string. 
        They are processed before parsing based on the grammar rules and so may be replaced
        by codepoints with significance in the grammar, such as ":" marking a prefixed name...."

        Solved problem with graphterm and blankNode which implicitely
