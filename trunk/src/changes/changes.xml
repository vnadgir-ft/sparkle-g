                Fixed antlr3 warnings emitted when compiling the Sparql.g file

                Added lexical rule "ANY" as fallback, in case no lexical rule matches
            </action>
            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">
                Recognition of keywords (including "true" and "false") is case insensitive now

                Solved problem with graphterm and blankNode which implicitely
                referenced WS via lexical rules NIL and ANON. As WS sends its content
                to channel hidden this resulted in problems with WS before and after
                braces
            </action>
            <action dev="Juergen.Pfundt" type="add">

                Modified one test case to test "comments".
