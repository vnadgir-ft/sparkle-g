== SPARKLE-G built on ANLTR V4 ==

=== Pretty Printer and Syntactic Validator for the SPARQL 1.1 Query and Update Language ===
The sparkle-g project has released a pretty printer and syntactic validator for the [http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/ SPARQL 1.1 Query] and 
[http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-sparql11-update-20110512/ Update Language] [http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/ http://sparkle-g.googlecode.com/svn/site/images/sw-sparql-green.png]. The pretty printer and syntactic validator is based on the [http://antlr.org/ ANTLR] framework for constructing recognizers, interpreters, compilers, and translators. The generation of the formatted output text relies on the [http://www.stringtemplate.org/ StringTemplate] template engine. [http://antlr.org/ ANTLR] and 
[http://www.stringtemplate.org/ StringTemplate] have both been crafted by [http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~parrt/ Terence Parr], a professor of computer science at the [http://www.cs.usfca.edu/ University of San Francisco].
 
The concept of Antlr V4 differs dramatically from its predecessors. The effects of these changes on the Sparkle project result in modifications of the grammar for the SPARQL 1.1 Query and Update Language, the omission of the AST generation and a complete new action interface.  
The answer to the question “Why do we need ANTLR V4?” can be found [http://www.antlr.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=29130850 here]. 

=== How to build the Pretty Printer ===
The prerelase uses Ant as build tool. You should have Ant version 1.8 or later installed.
Java 1.6 or later is obligatory. 

Download the sparkle-pretty-printer-all-4-1.0.jar from the download page of the sparkle-g project. Unpack the  jar archive in a directory of your choice.

{{{
jar xvf sparkle-pretty-printer-all-4-1.0.jar
}}}

Change into the created sparkle-pretty-printer directory and type on the command line:

{{{
ant all
}}}

You should see a build progress information somehow like this:

{{{

= Automated Testing =

== Syntax Testing Using JUnit ==

JUnit is used for testing the SPARQL 1.1 syntax as defined in the Sparql.g grammar file. At the moment more than 500 test queries are part of the testsuite.

=== Running the JUnit tests ===

{{{
ant junit
}}}

The execution of the test cases is logged in TEST-com.googlecode.sparkleg.IdentGunitOKTest.txt.
A detailed evaluation of each test case can be found in target/src/test/java/com/googlecode/sparkleg/syntactic_validator1.log.

== Grammar Testing ==

A parameterized JUnit test is dynamically set up, which includes all queries from the Sparql.testsuite file with expected GUnit status OK.
{{{
final String REGEX = "(^\\s*<<)(.*?)(>>\\s*(OK|FAIL)\\s*$)";
}}}
All queries extracted from the GUnit file are treated as described below:

 # a test query is processed by the Sparkle Pretty Printer
 # the output of the transformation process, the re-formatted query is saved as response1
 # this response1 query is sent through the Sparkle Printer transformation pipeline, too
 # the resulting output response2 is compared to response1. In case of equality the test case is evaluated as successfull

A stable transformation algorithm should result in no changes when
repeatedly applied on the generated output. This behaviour is neccessary but not sufficient to yield a well formed reformatted query. For this reason the three data sequences: original query, response1 and response2 are written for manual inspection in a log file.

=== DAWG Test Data ===

Most of the JUnit test cases are based on the DAWG {{{data-r2}}} and {{{data-sparql11}}} testsuites. The start of the DAWG test cases is marked in the {{{Sparql.testsuite}}} file and the {{{Sparql.gunit}}} file with the following disclaimer:

=== SPARQL 1.1 Example Queries ===

Another part of the test queries origin from the SPARQL 1.1 Query Language W3C Working Draft 12 May 2011 [http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/].

The following note signals the start of those queries:
{{{
/* 
 * The following testcases are taken from the w3.org (http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#grammar) SPARQL examples
 */
}}}
The chapter from which the queries had been taken is noted on top of the first query of a chapter. The example shows two queries from chapter {{{5.2.3 Group Graph Pattern Examples}}} followed by queries contained in chapter {{{6.1 Optional Pattern Matching}}}

{{{
// 5.2.3 Group Graph Pattern Examples
<<
PREFIX foaf:    <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
SELECT ?name ?mbox 
  {
    ?x foaf:name ?name . FILTER regex(?name, "Smith")
    ?x foaf:mbox ?mbox .
  }
>> OK

<<
PREFIX foaf:    <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
SELECT ?name ?mbox 
  {
    ?x foaf:name ?name .
    {}
    ?x foaf:mbox ?mbox .
  }
>> OK

// 6.1 Optional Pattern Matching
...
}}}   

=== Executing the Provided Tiny Example Program ===

Assemble the following jar-files in a directory of your choice: 

 * antlr-4.0.1-complete.jar
 * sparql4.jar 

Copy the ident.stg file and the query file input.rq into the directory, too. 
Execute the following command: 

The Windows way
{{{
java -cp antlr-4-1.0-complete.jar;sparql4.jar SparqlMain input.rq
}}}

The Unix way
{{{
java -cp antlr-4-1.0-complete.jar:sparql4.jar SparqlMain input.rq
}}}

You should receive the following output:

{{{

=== Syntax Highlighting ===

Switching to the StringTemplate group file html.stg renders a query in a simple HTML format.

An example of a reformatted query is shown here:

http://sparkle-g.googlecode.com/svn/site/images/HTML-Formatted-Query.png

The colors, fonts, etc. can be adapted without modification of Java code, just by editing the html.stg template.
